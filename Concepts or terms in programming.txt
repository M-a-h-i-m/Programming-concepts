Programming Language
------------------------------------
Programming Language means the language that we use to talk with Computers


Low-Level Language
------------------------------
These are the languages that are very close to the computer’s hardware. They are fast and efficient but harder for humans to read and write. 


Machine Language 
----------------------------
Machine language originated in the 1940s, consisting of a series of 0s and 1s. It means that Machine language is the language that is easily understood by computers, but hard for humans to understand. It's fast cause it is close to the hardware. and it's not portable.
Example: 10110010 11001011


Assembly Language
------------------------------
 Slightly easier than machine language because it uses mnemonics (short words) instead of pure binary.
 Example: MOV AX, 1 (moves value 1 into register AX)


High-Level Languages
---------------------------------
These languages are closer to human language, making them easier to read, write, and maintain.


Middle-Level Languages
------------------------------------
These are a mix of low-level and high-level languages. 
Example: C

Flow-chart
--------------------
A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps in a process using symbols and arrows. It’s a simple way to make complicated tasks easier to understand.

🧿What a flowchart includes
		⬇️			     
➡️ Oval → Start or end
➡️Rectangle → Action or task
➡️Diamond → Decision (yes/no or true/false)
➡️Arrows → Show the order of steps

🧿What flowcharts are used for

➡️Explaining how a system or program works
➡️Planning computer algorithms
➡️Showing business or work processes
➡️Troubleshooting or decision-making guides

Example (simple):

   [Start]
      |
      v
 [Get ingredients]
      |
      v
 [Cook food]
      |
      v
    [Eat]
      |
      v
    [End]



Pseudocode
----------------

Pseudocode is a simple, plain-language way of writing the steps of a program or algorithm without using real programming syntax.

It looks like code, but it’s not tied to any specific programming language—its purpose is to explain the logic clearly.

✅ Why pseudocode is useful

♦️Helps plan a program before writing real code
♦️Easy to read and understand
♦️Focuses on logic, not syntax
♦️Useful for communicating ideas between people who know different programming languages

🧠 What pseudocode looks like

START
  INPUT number1
  INPUT number2
  total ← number1 + number2
  OUTPUT total
END



Linear Search
-----------------

A linear search is the simplest searching method used to find a specific item in a list. It checks each element one by one from the beginning until it finds the target—or reaches the end.

🔍 Example

List: [4, 7, 9, 2, 5]
Target: 2

Steps:

♦️Check 4 → not 2
♦️Check 7 → not 2
♦️Check 9 → not 2
♦️Check 2 → ✔ found!
