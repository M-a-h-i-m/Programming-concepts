Programming Language
------------------------------------
Programming Language means the language that we use to talk with Computers


Low-Level Language
------------------------------
These are the languages that are very close to the computer’s hardware. They are fast and efficient but harder for humans to read and write. 


Machine Language 
----------------------------
Machine language originated in the 1940s, consisting of a series of 0s and 1s. It means that Machine language is the language that is easily understood by computers, but hard for humans to understand. It's fast cause it is close to the hardware. and it's not portable.
Example: 10110010 11001011


Assembly Language
------------------------------
 Slightly easier than machine language because it uses mnemonics (short words) instead of pure binary.
 Example: MOV AX, 1 (moves value 1 into register AX)


High-Level Languages
---------------------------------
These languages are closer to human language, making them easier to read, write, and maintain.


Middle-Level Languages
------------------------------------
These are a mix of low-level and high-level languages. 
Example: C

Variable
---------
A variable is a named storage location in a program that holds data. Its value can change during program execution, allowing the program to store, update, and use information when needed.

Example:
jilan = 10 //Here Jilan is a variable and it contains the value 10


String
----------
A string is a data type used to store sequences of characters. It represents text such as letters, words, or symbols and is treated as a single piece of data by the program.

Example:
String = "Mahim"  //Here 'Mahim' is character with a few character


Data Type
----------
A data type defines the kind of data a variable can store and determines how the computer will interpret and handle that data. It sets rules for the size, format, and type of operations allowed on the stored value.

Example:
integer   = 12
float     = 12.5
String    = "Mahim"
Character = 'c'
Boolean   = True/False


Conditional Statement
--------------------------
A conditional statement allows a program to make decisions by checking whether a condition is true or false. Based on the result, the program chooses a specific path or action to execute.

Example:

if(condition):
  statement
elif(condition):
  statement
else:
  statement


Loop
-------
A loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It helps automate repetitive tasks and reduces code duplication.

Example:
 
 for i in range(start,step,stop):
  statement


Function
----------
A function is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a specific operation. It improves code organization, reduces repetition, and allows tasks to be reused throughout a program.

Example:

 def FunctionName(parameter1,parameter2):
    statememt
  return answer


Array
----------
An array is a structured collection of multiple values stored under a single name, where each value is kept at a specific position (index). It helps manage lists of related data efficiently.

Exaple:

ArrayName = [1,2,3,6]


2d Array
------------
A 2D array is an array made up of other arrays, arranged in rows and columns. It is used to represent data in a grid-like structure and is useful for storing tabular or matrix-based data.

Exaple:

ArrayName = [
  [1,2,3,6],
  [3,6,5,8,9,6,3,5],
  [7,8,9,6,5,47,8,3,6,9,5]
]


Mountain Array
-------------------

A mountain array is a special type of array (or list) that first strictly increases to a peak element and then strictly decreases after that.

Example:

array = [2,3,6,9,4,2,1]

__visual__:    
                        9
                      6   4
                    3       2
                  2           1

Dictionary
----------------
In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data structure used to store data in key–value pairs.
It’s similar to a real-life dictionary, where a word (key) maps to its definition (value).
we can't use dictionary and List to key but can use all of them as a value

Example:

student = {
    "name": "Mahim",
    "age": 22,
    "department": "CSE"
    "Subject": ["Mechanics","BBA","Law"]
     12:True
}


Static Language
-------------------------
A static language is one where data types are fixed and checked before the program runs. This leads to early detection of type errors, stronger structure, and often better performance.

Example: C,C++,Java,C#,Swift,Go,Rust


Dynamic Language
----------------------------
A dynamic language checks and assigns data types while the program is running. It allows greater flexibility, easier coding, and faster development but may catch type errors later.

Example: Python,JavaScript,Ruby,PHP,Perl,Lua,MATLAB


Debugging
-----------
Debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors or unexpected behavior in a program. It ensures the code runs correctly and helps improve program reliability and performance.


Flow-chart
--------------------
A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps in a process using symbols and arrows. It’s a simple way to make complicated tasks easier to understand.

🧿What a flowchart includes
		⬇️			     
➡️ Oval → Start or end
➡️Rectangle → Action or task
➡️Diamond → Decision (yes/no or true/false)
➡️Arrows → Show the order of steps
➡️Parallelogram → Input/Output


🧿What flowcharts are used for

➡️Explaining how a system or program works
➡️Planning computer algorithms
➡️Showing business or work processes
➡️Troubleshooting or decision-making guides

Example (simple):

   [Start]
      |
      v
 [Get ingredients]
      |
      v
 [Cook food]
      |
      v
    [Eat]
      |
      v
    [End]



Pseudocode
----------------

Pseudocode is a simple, plain-language way of writing the steps of a program or algorithm without using real programming syntax.

It looks like code, but it’s not tied to any specific programming language—its purpose is to explain the logic clearly.

✅ Why pseudocode is useful

♦️Helps plan a program before writing real code
♦️Easy to read and understand
♦️Focuses on logic, not syntax
♦️Useful for communicating ideas between people who know different programming languages

🧠 What pseudocode looks like

START
  INPUT number1
  INPUT number2
  total ← number1 + number2
  OUTPUT total
END



Linear Search
-----------------

A linear search is the simplest searching method used to find a specific item in a list. It checks each element one by one from the beginning until it finds the target—or reaches the end.

🔍 Example

List: [4, 7, 9, 2, 5]
Target: 2

Steps:

♦️Check 4 → not 2
♦️Check 7 → not 2
♦️Check 9 → not 2
♦️Check 2 → ✔ found!


Binary Search
----------------

Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.

⭐ Simple Definition
Binary Search divides the search space in half every time until the target is found.

🔥 Key Points

♦️ Works only on sorted data (ascending or descending).
♦️ Much faster than linear search.
♦️ Time complexity: O(log n)


📘 How it Works (easy explanation)
  Suppose you want to find a number in a sorted list:
♦️ Check the middle element.
♦️ If it’s equal → Found 🎯
♦️ If the target is smaller, search the left half.
♦️ If the target is bigger, search the right half.
♦️ Repeat until found or nothing left.


Algorithm:
♦️ sort the array in accending order
♦️ find the middle point, mid = (Upper bound + Lower bound)/2
♦️ if(array[mid] > array[data]):
      left = mid + 1
   elif(array[mid] < array[data]):
      right = mid - 1
   elif(array[mid] == array[data]):
      return "mid_found"
 
📊 Example

Array:
[2, 5, 7, 12, 18, 20]
Find 12:

♦️ Middle → 7 → 12 is bigger → go right
♦️ New middle → 18 → 12 is smaller → go left
♦️ New middle → 12 → Found


Time and Space Complexity
------------------------------

Time and Space Complexity describe how efficient an algorithm is.
These two ideas help you understand how much time and memory your code needs when input size increases.

⏱️ 1. Time Complexity (How fast your algorithm runs)

Time Complexity tells you how the running time changes as the size of input (n) grows.

⭐ Common Time Complexities

♦️O(1) → Constant time (super fast)
    Example: accessing an array element
♦️O(n) → Linear time
    Example: looping once over an array
♦️O(n²) → Quadratic time
    Example: nested loops
♦️O(log n) → Logarithmic time
    Example: binary search
♦️O(n log n) → Good for sorting algorithms
    Example: merge sort, quicksort (average)

✨ Purpose:
To compare algorithms without running them.



The ceiling number
---------------------
The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to that number
