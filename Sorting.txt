Bubble sort
--------------------

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms in computer science. It works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in a list (or array) and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

This process continues until the list is completely sorted.

🔹 How Bubble Sort Works:
01. Start at the beginning of the list.
02. Compare the first two elements.
03. If the first is greater than the second → swap them.
04. Move to the next pair and repeat until you reach the end.
05. After the first pass, the largest element will be at the end of the 
    list.
06. Repeat the process for the remaining (unsorted) elements.
07. Continue until no swaps are needed — the list is now sorted



🔹 Example:

Suppose we have this list:
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 1:

01. Compare 5 and 3 → swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
02. Compare 5 and 8 → no swap
03. Compare 8 and 4 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
04. Compare 8 and 2 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
→Largest element (8) “bubbles” to the end.3

Pass 2
[3, 5, 4, 2, 8] → [3, 4, 2, 5, 8] → [3, 2, 4, 5, 8] → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Now the array is sorted.

🔹 Pseudocode:
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-2
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])


🔹 Time Complexity:
01. Best case: O(n) — when the list is already sorted
02. Average and Worst case: O(n²) — because of nested loops


🔹 Space Complexity:
O(1) — in-place sorting (no extra memory used)

🔹 Key Idea:
In Bubble Sort, large values "bubble up" to the end, while smaller values gradually "sink" to the beginning.

Selection Sort
----------------

🔹 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element (for ascending order) from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

It divides the array into two parts:

01. A sorted part (on the left)
02. An unsorted part (on the right)


➡️MY OPINION:
It's just Assuming the first element as the smallest one and then comparing it with others if something is smaller than that the position will be swapped.
Then Do it with the rest of the Array.



🔹 Step-by-Step Process:

Suppose:
arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

Pass 1:
Smallest element in [3, 1, 5, 4, 2] is 1.
Swap 1 with first element (3).
→ [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]


Pass 2:
Find smallest in remaining [3, 5, 4, 2] → 2
Swap 2 with 3
→ [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]


Pass 3:
Find smallest in [5, 4, 3] → 3
Swap 3 with 5
→ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Pass 4:
Find smallest in [4, 5] → already sorted


✅ Final sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



🔹 Pseudocode:
for i = 0 to n-2:
    min_index = i
    for j = i+1 to n-1:
        if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = j
    swap(arr[i], arr[min_index])
