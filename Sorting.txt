Bubble sort
--------------------

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms in computer science. It works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in a list (or array) and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

This process continues until the list is completely sorted.

🔹 How Bubble Sort Works:
01. Start at the beginning of the list.
02. Compare the first two elements.
03. If the first is greater than the second → swap them.
04. Move to the next pair and repeat until you reach the end.
05. After the first pass, the largest element will be at the end of the 
    list.
06. Repeat the process for the remaining (unsorted) elements.
07. Continue until no swaps are needed — the list is now sorted



🔹 Example:

Suppose we have this list:
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 1:

01. Compare 5 and 3 → swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
02. Compare 5 and 8 → no swap
03. Compare 8 and 4 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
04. Compare 8 and 2 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
→Largest element (8) “bubbles” to the end.3

Pass 2
[3, 5, 4, 2, 8] → [3, 4, 2, 5, 8] → [3, 2, 4, 5, 8] → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Now the array is sorted.

🔹 Pseudocode:
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-2
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])


🔹 Time Complexity:
01. Best case: O(n) — when the list is already sorted
02. Average and Worst case: O(n²) — because of nested loops


🔹 Space Complexity:
O(1) — in-place sorting (no extra memory used)

🔹 Key Idea:
In Bubble Sort, large values "bubble up" to the end, while smaller values gradually "sink" to the beginning.

Selection Sort
----------------

🔹 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element (for ascending order) from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

It divides the array into two parts:

01. A sorted part (on the left)
02. An unsorted part (on the right)


➡️MY OPINION:
It's just Assuming the first element as the smallest one and then comparing it with others if something is smaller than that the position will be swapped.
Then Do it with the rest of the Array.



🔹 Step-by-Step Process:

Suppose:
arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

Pass 1:
Smallest element in [3, 1, 5, 4, 2] is 1.
Swap 1 with first element (3).
→ [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]


Pass 2:
Find smallest in remaining [3, 5, 4, 2] → 2
Swap 2 with 3
→ [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]


Pass 3:
Find smallest in [5, 4, 3] → 3
Swap 3 with 5
→ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Pass 4:
Find smallest in [4, 5] → already sorted


✅ Final sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



🔹 Pseudocode:
for i = 0 to n-2:
    min_index = i
    for j = i+1 to n-1:
        if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = j
    swap(arr[i], arr[min_index])

Insertion Sort
---------------------



🔹 What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works the same way you might sort playing cards in your hand.

➡️MY OPINION:
It's just sorting first two elements on step 1 then first three on step 2 then four,five and so on.

🔹 Step-by-Step Idea
Suppose you have:
arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

We divide the array into two parts:

01. Left part: Sorted portion
02. Right part: Unsorted portion

Then we move through the array, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted part.

Step 1:
Sorted: [3]
Unsorted: [1, 5, 4, 2]
→ Insert 1 before 3 → [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]

Step 2:
Now sorted: [1, 3, 5]
Next element 4 goes before 5 → [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]

Step 3:
Next element 2 goes before 3 → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

✅ Done — fully sorted!



🔹 Algorithm (Logic)
For each element (starting from index 1):

01. Take it as the key.
02. Compare it with all elements before it.
03. Move all larger elements one position right.
04. Insert the key at its correct position

Cyclic Sort
------------------

⚙️ What is Cyclic Sort?
Cyclic Sort is a sorting algorithm used when:

The numbers are in a known range, usually 1 to n.
The array may be unsorted, but all numbers are unique (or sometimes have small duplicates).

It’s not a general-purpose sorting algorithm like bubble sort or merge sort —
it’s a pattern used to solve specific problems efficiently (in O(n) time).


🧩 Example
Say you have:
arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

Numbers are from 1 to 5.

The correct position of each number = (number - 1)

01. 1 → index 0
02. 2 → index 1
03. 3 → index 2
04. 4 → index 3
05. 5 → index 4

Now we just need to place each number in its correct position.

🧠 Algorithm Intuition
We go through the array index by index:

01. Check if the current number is in the correct position.
02. If yes → move to the next index.
03. If not → swap it with the number at its correct position.
04. Repeat until all numbers are in place.

💻 Example Step-by-Step
Start: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

♦️i = 0 → value = 3 → correct index = 2
→ swap index 0 and 2
→ [5, 1, 3, 4, 2]

♦️i = 0 → value = 5 → correct index = 4
→ swap index 0 and 4
→ [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]

♦️i = 0 → value = 2 → correct index = 1
→ swap index 0 and 1
→ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


🚀 Time and Space Complexity

01. Time: O(n) — because each number is swapped at most once.
02. Space: O(1) — it’s done in-place (no extra array).

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Missing Number            | Find which number is missing from 0–n |
| Find All Missing Numbers  | Find all missing numbers in 1–n       |
| Find the Duplicate Number | Detect duplicate without extra space  |
| Set Mismatch              | One number missing and one duplicate  |
