Linear Search
-----------------

A linear search is the simplest searching method used to find a specific item in a list. It checks each element one by one from the beginning until it finds the target—or reaches the end.

🔍 Example

List: [4, 7, 9, 2, 5]
Target: 2

Steps:

♦️Check 4 → not 2
♦️Check 7 → not 2
♦️Check 9 → not 2
♦️Check 2 → ✔ found!


Binary Search
----------------

Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.

⭐ Simple Definition
Binary Search divides the search space in half every time until the target is found.

🔥 Key Points

♦️ Works only on sorted data (ascending or descending).
♦️ Much faster than linear search.
♦️ Time complexity: O(log n)


📘 How it Works (easy explanation)
  Suppose you want to find a number in a sorted list:
♦️ Check the middle element.
♦️ If it’s equal → Found 🎯
♦️ If the target is smaller, search the left half.
♦️ If the target is bigger, search the right half.
♦️ Repeat until found or nothing left.


Algorithm:
♦️ sort the array in accending order
♦️ find the middle point, mid = (Upper bound + Lower bound)/2
♦️ if(array[mid] > array[data]):
      left = mid + 1
   elif(array[mid] < array[data]):
      right = mid - 1
   elif(array[mid] == array[data]):
      return "mid_found"
 
📊 Example

Array:
[2, 5, 7, 12, 18, 20]
Find 12:

♦️ Middle → 7 → 12 is bigger → go right
♦️ New middle → 18 → 12 is smaller → go left
♦️ New middle → 12 → Found
